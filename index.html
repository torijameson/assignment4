         <h1>In the beginning was floppy disk internet and getting in trouble for clogging the phone line.
         <p>To be more precise, the first computer I can remeber was probably on television - Reading Rainbow or something. Nobody had one at home. I had to do a report on a dinosaur in the second grade and we went to the library and printed off pages on the dinosaur from the encycopedia that was accessed with help from the librarian on a number of large format floppies. Within a year, my parents had bought us a PC - and it ran Windows 3.1 AND in my memory, the selling point of that machine was that we had a CD drive to play CDs and the included Encyclopedia Britannica CD and a program that was a tour with videos of the San Diego Zoo. It wasnt until I was in the sixth grade that I remember anything about the so-called "world wide web". My friend Kimmie had it at her house and we were able to get onto AOL Kids - a walled garden of clickable buttons and heavily moderated content with a few simple games... and tons of essentially unmoderated chatrooms with whoever happened to be in them. Having replaced their computer (now running a later version of Windows 95), My parents asked our neighbor to help them set up Aol 3.0 from a floppy disk and we made screennames that were just our first and last names, which  then they chenged to things like "volley2" (mine because I played volleyball) and "johntheguitarman" (my dad's because his name is John and he loves guitar) after they saw a nightly news segment about the dangers of not being anonymous on the internet. </p>

         If seeing this photograph is making you nostalgic, there is a group making an <a href="https://aolemu.com"> AOL 3.0 emulator </a>. It appears that you can also tinker with it through a Github repo.

         <h2>Finding my way.... </h2>
         <p1> I found myself having some occasional time to be able to play on the internet and after clicking around through the gated walls I bought a "Dummies Guide to the Internet" (in 1997 or so) and it showed me how to use search engines like Ask Jeeves and Alta Vista. I as able to then search for anything I wanted, and with the all the world's knowledge at my fingertips... I searched for cat pictures. And then, realizing I could find for free what <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AOaemvIGiEDSP2HNRMo02rBPVO9FIaPcpA:1636948061528&source=univ&tbm=isch&q=tiger+beat+magazine+1990s&client=firefox-b-1-d&fir=FY02tVeAnjfrjM%252C--qie_XBd0PaEM%252C_%253Buuc9NrOdOE4NAM%252CF-FONtA_YjTq3M%252C_%253BxKcj2FoqgF08CM%252CPmUO5o163j5ixM%252C_%253B8wTSuZ3tTGDxMM%252Cgx5xG_p65mXvGM%252C_%253B2uiDEul1bQvchM%252C5kGjhZ90IB_7rM%252C_%253BXrXeWUjRlWpcVM%252Cgx5xG_p65mXvGM%252C_%253Bjg4qMpwoHzEmJM%252CC0X6HfwP-zL3ZM%252C_%253BIHjn_K9zY7QKQM%252CkGgl-tnx3GKxAM%252C_%253B4J1cznPmnqRQEM%252CF-FONtA_YjTq3M%252C_%253B_Ksbwgd85C8FOM%252CvMcS2NcesnDKcM%252C_%253B77lfrIplrxqUaM%252CRkLf4wwK7ph6MM%252C_%253B-AL4EkCwXUQc5M%252Cgx5xG_p65mXvGM%252C_%253Bxg8SADYlGp75tM%252CV_cxYF8xKV8R-M%252C_%253BGEa4oHB82FMJyM%252C0hr4r0PGAyVrVM%252C_%253BYdY7zg7H6DC97M%252C2xqrKXGAM-szWM%252C_%253B_8xdechy0264qM%252C3yy_WUhnL_gG6M%252C_%253BrAf-7nNa_ObcVM%252C6V4d0U2k2VdhfM%252C_%253BgthD7mcgRcXi0M%252C2xqrKXGAM-szWM%252C_&usg=AI4_-kRseXsUn5JOqZyUSR_pLsqjDj7MRw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG4uPdupn0AhWFmGoFHYS9DA4Q7Al6BAgGEEQ&biw=1366&bih=615&dpr=1">Tiger Beat Magazine</a> was selling to me at incredibly  high cost (relative to my income of babysitting and petsitting money). with this being peak time for Total Request Live with Carson Daly, I had my afternoon Capri Sun and granola bar while watching all the boy bands. </p1>

         <h1>Reflecton</h1>
         <p1 id="testP" class="funParagraph"> Ive been thinking a lot about the impact this fandom had on me, with the exaggerated (exasperating) lyrics and a very particular form of manhood based in conspicious consumption and relationship to women. (another sentance needed). </p1>
         <p2>In part, this period in my life allowed me a safe place to perform feminity without any undesired consequences to earn the approving (if a bit annoyed by the whole made-for-market enterprise) gaze of my parents and teachers. I suspect they knew I was gay, but I lived in a bubbled world of 1990s white conservative suburbia where homosexuality was the biggest sin* you could commit. Loudly and publically loving boy bands let me flag that I was willing to follow the strictures of the society I lived in, and that I was safe (*straight*) enough to be allowed access to the an widening world (still within the bubble) my teenage years, maturation and quest for more independence should otherwise grant me.   </p2>

         <h3> Mouseover for a Sidebar on the Ranking of Sins </h3>
         <!-- mouseover event here pulling in the below paragraph. iframe tag?-->
         <p1>Ranking sin is a ridiculous idea but it has some biblical roots. In the New Testament, Jesus is most concerned with people dying having hoarded their wealthy and not having spent their lives and fortunes caring for the needs  (For example- the infamous aphorism "it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than it is for a rich man to enter Heaven (Matthew 19:24). Contrary to that teaching, many in the world I grew up in would be unconcerned with wealth acccumultion (because you must have worked hard for it and working hard is a high value) and instead focused on direct behavioral tresspasses. Homosexuality to this world is anathema because (to their prespective) it was a "deviance" from the prescribed lives they led and taught as (literal) gospel AND it was a (to them) a CHOSEN deviance. Someone lies because they are caught or to get ahead-- and while lying is a sin, they would see it as a lesser as its a sin of circumstance (and also why they would place murder in the same lesser category). Homosexuality is a sin, and the biggest sin, because this deviance (again, to them) is concenously chosen and can be resisted. All sin Lying, anger so fierce and sustained it needs to deadly consequences-   </p1>
